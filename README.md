# graphql-node-mock
create a graphql server with node


## install
```
npm install
```

## start a server
```
node server.js
```


### if you want to use graphql-tools use function, please see testDemo/app.js. It support you coding schema types with string, and I think if you like typescript, this style is more suitable for you, and you also can use merge schema plugin to seperate you module.
